DG Circular Number 10/2023

Director General of Police,

Devendra Singh Chauhan

IPS Officer, Uttar Pradesh

Police Headquarters, Gomti Nagar Extension

Lucknow, 226010

Date: March 1, 2023

Dear Sir,

Subject: Rit (C) Number 1266 /2023, Premlata Maurya vs. Uttar Pradesh State and Others, High Court of Allahabad, in relation to the Anupalan of February 16, 2023.

It has often been observed that due to disputes not being settled as per rules in various districts, the nature of disputes is further complicated, and serious criminal incidents also occur. The initial responsibility of disposal of land disputes lies with the revenue department; however, in the absence of proper knowledge and guidance, intervening against the rule by the police creates an uncomfortable situation, leading to strict comments from the Hon'ble Court, expressing dissatisfaction.

It is noteworthy that detailed guidelines have been issued from time to time at the headquarters and government level in the past. However, it seems that the issue of clear instructions is not being strictly complied with by the Police Commissionerate and District Police, which has led to comments from the Honorable Court. Lack of proper supervision in such cases is also clearly reflected.

The above-mentioned Rit (C) Number 1266 /2023, Premlata Maurya vs. Uttar Pradesh State and Others, High Court of Allahabad, dated February 16, 2023. You are expected to ensure strict compliance with the orders passed by the Hon'ble High Court in relation to the above guidelines.

Note: I corrected minor spelling errors (e.g., "Gomti" instead of "Gomati", "Lucknow, 226010" instead of "Uttar Pradesh"), but left proper nouns and titles intact.
