When an arrested person who does not know the victim is taken into custody, they should be sent to court for a prompt inquiry and medical examination. The court should be requested to decide on the date as soon as possible for identity proceedings. It should be ensured that their face is covered while taking them to court. If the person identifying the arrested person is mentally or physically disabled, then such a process of identification will be conducted under the supervision of a judicial magistrate, who will take appropriate steps to ensure that the identifier's identity remains confidential.

Identity videography

Videography of the identity process should be done. However, if a person identified by the arrested person is mentally or physically disabled, then the identity process will be videographed.
