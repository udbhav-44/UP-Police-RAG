**Public Interface**

The policemen run the news by questioning their behavior on social media and media in response to complaints about stimulation and indecent behavior from the complainants, which tarnishes the image of the police in the public.

To curb such news, it is essential that policemen behave impartially with every complainant, keeping in mind the mood and mannerisms. They should not use indecent language under any circumstances and take action against individuals as per rules while recording a video of abusive language or conduct towards the police.

In the event of a question mark on the behavior of the police in the media, the entire video should also be reflected in the media by providing the entire video to the media.

**3. CCTVs**

All police stations should have functioning CCTV cameras installed at the station, so that all activities can be recorded as evidence.

**4. Cases related to corruption and indecent behavior of policemen**

* Consuming bawaridi drug and found on the road in an intoxicated state.
* Conducting unethical and independent conduct by policemen.
* Traveling without tickets in trains or buses.
* Not treating criminals brought by policemen according to rules.
Due to these circumstances, adverse news often goes out in the media, causing an uncomfortable situation for the department. If news related to these activities of policemen is run in the media, then a statement related to it should also be given in the media after conducting a delay of the related case.

**5. Digital social media**

In recent years, digital media has become extremely important as a major means of communication. The media cell will inform authorities about information of immediate importance by continuously monitoring digital media.

It has often been seen that at the district level, the first news comes in local WhatsApp groups, which starts running on electronic channels and social media after a few hours. Therefore, taking cognizance of news running on local WhatsApp group and social media, the police should immediately respond to the same WhatsApp group and social media platforms (as a template or byte), so that related news is run in electronic media.

In addition to monitoring digital media in the control room, additional two constable chief constables will be appointed in the media cell, which will be connected to WhatsApp groups of all district media. Police proceedings will be sent to these WhatsApp groups.

**6. Important points related to circular**

* Installation of control room: A control room will be set up in the eastern installed media cell, which will work 24 hours. In this, an additional big screen and TV splitter will be installed to watch all national channels and regional channels.
* Appointment of manpower: Media cell works will be supervised by inspector-level officers. In addition to the manpower mentioned in the earlier DG Circular 18/2018, three additional constables and two additional police officers will be appointed for monitoring WhatsApp channels.
* Monitoring: Monitoring of electronic channels, social media, local WhatsApp groups will be done every 24 hours, and news related to the police will be sent to higher authorities on an hourly basis.
* Press briefing: Regarding commendable and human work and criminal incidents of the police, a daily press briefing will be held at 4:00 pm by the district in-charge of the district police or the case nominated by them.

**Instructions related to human rights of accused and victims**

The arrested person should not be presented to the media. The face of such an accused whose proceedings have to be identified should not be opened. After using necessary force by policemen in a law and order situation, the police's side should stop adverse news in the media after using necessary force.

I am confident that you will start a new and healthy tradition of interaction and dialogue between the media and police, following all the above-mentioned points, so that the work of the police can be correct and public faith can increase towards the police.

Sincerely,

Vijay Kumar

To all heads of department, office of the office, Police Department, Uttar Pradesh.
