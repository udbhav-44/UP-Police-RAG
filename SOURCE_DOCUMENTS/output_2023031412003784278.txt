Even after the completion of any witness's testimony in court, security can be provided considering the crisis assessment by the committee constituted under the Witness Security Scheme 2018 regarding its safety.

All zonal Additional Police Director Generals have been assigned responsibilities as nodal officers to raise awareness about the provisions of the Witness Safety Scheme and sensitize police personnel at the field level.

All Police Commissionerates should implement the action under the leadership of the Commissioner of Police.

In relation to the instructions mentioned and the rights of Witnesses in the Sakshi Suraksha Yojana 2018, a notice board will be installed at each police station in all districts, displaying the process of applying for security under the Witness Safety Scheme 2018 and the telephone number of the concerned officers. This way, victims and public coming to the police station can get acquainted with the provisions of the scheme and avail its benefits.

For effective implementation of Sakshi Suraksha Scheme-2018, all personnel should be appointed as nodal officers at Zone/District/Commissionerate level for briefing in this regard. It should be ensured that at the time of duty briefing in each police station, the main points of the Sakshi Suraksha Yojana 2018 will be read by the police station In-charge and mentioned in the general diary.
