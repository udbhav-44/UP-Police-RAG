Subject: Criminal Appeal Number -472/2012 Ramnath vs. U.P. State and others: Necessary guidelines regarding compliance of order dated 21.02.2024 passed by the Supreme Court.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Please find attached the criminal appeal number FSDA (Gu)/Food/Rit/2024 dated May 1, 2024 with Annexures. The order passed by the Supreme Court has been directed to comply with the instructions given in 21.02.2024.

2. The Supreme Court, in its above judicial decision, has given the law and order that prosecution cannot be run simultaneously on charges of Section 59 of Food Safety and Standards Act and Section 272, 273 of IPC (Bhadvi). The provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act will override the provisions of IPC (Bhadvi).

The decision passed by the Supreme Court is as follows:-

21. The decision of this court in the case of Swami Achyutanand Tirtha does not deal with this contingency at all. In the case of the state of Maharashtra, the question of the effect of Section 97 of IPC (Bhadvi) did not arise for consideration by this court. The court dealt with simultaneous principles and concluded that there could be simultaneous prosecutions but conviction and sentence can be on one charge only. This proposition is based on what is incorporated in Section 26 of the GC Act. We have no manner of doubt that by virtue of Section 89 of IPC (Bhadvi), Section 59 will override the provisions of Sections 272 and 273 of IPC. Therefore, there will not be any question of Simultaneous Prosecution under both the statutes.

3. All of you are directed to inform all subordinates of all discussions and supervision officers in detail and ensure compliance with the said order of the Supreme Court.
