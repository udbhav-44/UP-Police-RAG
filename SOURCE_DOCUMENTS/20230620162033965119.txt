IPS

Director General of Police,

Uttar Pradesh

Police Headquarters, Gomtinagar Extension,

Lucknow-226010

Date: June 5, 2023.

Subject: Implementation of Section 8(3) of the Care and Protection of Juvenile Justice Act, 2015

Necessary guidelines regarding implementing rules.

Dear Sir/Madam,

It is often seen that girls and children are being illegally kept on police stations. In some cases, children and girls have been kept in the police station for several days, which is against Section 8(3)(i) of JJ Act, 2015. Under the POCSO Act, keeping any child in the police station is not only unfair, but also against the law. It seems that the Women's Honour Cell/Women's Power Line 1010 seems to be related to the Criminals Act-2015 and POCSO Act-2012 by the Women's Honour Cell/Women's Power Line 1010, related to crimes against children and girls. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is not being followed at your level, which tarnishes the image of the police in the general public. In this regard, the Kiran by the letter No.-RA/95/2022-23 dated 17.05.2023 from the members, Uttar Pradesh State Child Rights Protection Commission, Lucknow, has been expected that all police station heads of the state should be directed.

It has also been credited by the Hon'ble Commission that the Commission is constantly receiving such information that girls and children are being kept at police stations at night. In some cases, children and girls have been kept in the police station for several days, which is against Section 8(3) of JJ Act, 2015. Under the POCSO Act, keeping any child in the police station is not only unfair, but also against the law. For this, action can be taken against police personnel under Section-166A of IPC. If a child gets a child at night, then fill the format 42 (Juvenile Justice Act) and kept it in shelter homes and in districts where shelter homes are not available, the forest stop center should be kept in it.

Therefore, for the implementation of Section 8(3) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, members attached letter number of Uttar Pradesh Rights Protection Commission:-RAB/200/95/2022-23 dated 17.05.2023 are requested to strictly comply with these instructions.

Attachment: Yatopari

Sincerely,
