Subject: Necessary Guidelines Regarding the Preservation of Old People and Destitutes from Cold

Dear Sir/Madam,

You are aware that at present, the cold and fog are falling, which has led to a significant increase in the cold wave and frost. This weather is difficult for elderly and destitute people living in the open. Therefore, the management of cold prevention becomes even more necessary for them. The following action is required to be taken to prevent the cold affecting elderly and destitute people:

1. Necessary guidelines should be given to police personnel engaged in patrolling at night, especially those involved in PRV 112, that if any elderly or destitute person is found anywhere, then they are understood, honored, and taken to the nearest night shelters or old age homes, ensuring proper arrangements to prevent cold.

2. If an older destitute person is found at small and small railway platforms/railway stations around them, then they should be ensured proper arrangements for preventing cold.

3. Necessary support can be obtained in this regard by coordinating with every level of local administration and the social welfare department. If necessary, proper medical arrangements should be made.

You are directed to ensure that the above instructions are followed on a priority basis in your commissionerate and district.

Sincerely,
Vijay Kumar
Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh
