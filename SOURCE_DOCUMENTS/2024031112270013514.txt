Dear Sir,

A large number of cases, i.e., criminal writ petitions, bail applications, criminal appeals, are being filed before the Hon'ble High Court either by the gang leaders or the gang members in order to... The Gang Chart, on the basis of FIR under Section 2/3 of the Gangster Act has been lodged, does not disclose the antecedents of the accused.

During the course of hearing the concerned cases under the Gangster Act, the Hon'ble Court has shown its dismay with regard to the functioning of concerned authorities who have failed to comply with the requisite mandatory provisions enshrined either under the rules framed under Section 23 of the UP Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 read with Section 21 of the UP General Clauses Act, 1904.

The rules framed under the UP Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 provide that the Gang Chart shall contain the offenses which have been reported after January 23, 2015; however, the prior criminal antecedents of the gang members or the gang leader are not being disclosed. Consequently, the court has directed that detailed guidelines be issued to all district magistrates, commissioners of police/SSPS/additional SPS, etc., to ensure that the provisions of the Gangster Act, 1986 are complied with in letter and spirit.

Therefore, you are requested to issue necessary guidelines to all concerned authorities to ensure that the preparation of the Gang Chart should strictly follow the provisions as provided, 2021, and the gangster act antecedents should be disclosed properly in the Gang Chart so that interested parties do not face any different in future. The court has further directed that the Chief Secretary, UP, should issue necessary guidelines in compliance with the orders passed by the Court.

This letter is being sent as per the direction of the Hon'ble Court.

Yours faithfully,
