1. The arrangement of marking in its handwriting in the Crime Register SR letter by Supervision Officers is prevalent, but these rules and traditions are not being complied with properly by the Supervision Officers. No meaningful and clear instructions are being provided by the Supervision Officers to determine the direction of investigation on the Crime Register or SR paper. Therefore, it is necessary that the crime register/SR letters prevalent in the district should be made quickly. The Additional Superintendent of Police/Inspector General of Police/Deputy Inspector General of Police will review the unique status of the Crime Register of SR SR of their subordinate districts. Crime registers/SR letters will be reviewed accidentally from the headquarters level.

2. I expect S.R. Regarding the preparation of letters and crime registers, the former circulars issued from this headquarters level and organize a workshop in each district and inform the officers regarding the instructions and ensure strict compliance.

Sincerely,
