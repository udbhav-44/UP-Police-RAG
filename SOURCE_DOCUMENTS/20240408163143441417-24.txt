Number: 11678/2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

Please follow Section 482 Number: 11678/2023 Ram Gopal Gupta vs Uttar Pradesh State and 03 other related M.S.432/2020 Section 384 Bhadwi Police Station Lonar, District Hardoi to take the order passed by the High Court on December 14, 2023.

Trouble arose when the MU against the petitioner in the High Court (M.S.432/2020 Section 384) charged sheet filed in court was canceled on October 13, 2020.

In the case of Yachi Ram Gopal Gupta posted in Hardoi district, a video of illegal recovery went viral, against him.

432/2020 Section 384 Bhadwi, Thana Lonar, Hardoi district

Regarding the investigation and evidence of the investigation, the High Court gave its decision on December 14, 2023. The following comments were made:

17. It is evident from the record that no alleged photograph is annexed with the case diary. Further, when there is no aggrived person in the case of extraction, then merely on the basis of imagination, no such person can be implicated.

As the chargesheet was prepared by the prosecuting officer and approved by the circle officer of the area in question in a most negligent manner without considering the ingredients of Section 383 I.P.C., this court is of the view that the impugned charge sheet dated October 13, 2020, and its consequential proceedings as well as the summoning order dated April 25, 2022, along with the Order dated August 2, 2023, are hereby canceled.

18. A sum of Rs. 2 lakh is hereby ordered to be provided as compensation to the accused.

Therefore, all of you are directed to submit the charge sheet after deliberations before doing so, it should be ensured that the Indian Penal Code definition of crime in 1860 certified evidence in relation to all the existing mandatory elements has been grossed under supervision.

It is also the responsibility of the officers to review the proof of the gross evidence during the deliberations and take a legal vote of prosecution as required.

All Police Commissioner, Senior Superintendent of Police, Superintendent of Police, In-charge District, Uttar Pradesh
