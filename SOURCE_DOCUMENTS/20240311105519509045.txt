Subject: Compliance with Uttar Pradesh Gangism and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act-1986 and Uttar Pradesh Gang and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Rules-2021

Dear Sir/Madam,

The Uttar Pradesh Gangism and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Rules-2021, Notification No. 5203/VI/Pu0-9/2021-31(43)/2013 dated 27.12.2021, which has been reported by immediate effect, is applicable. Complete compliance with the provisions of the Rules-2021 for legal action, as per Additional Director General of Police Crime Uttar Pradesh's letter number: DG Seven-S-14 (09)/2021 dated 25.04.2022 and letter number of Adhocharpatri: DG Seven S-14 (09)/2021 has been directed earlier by 01.06.2022, DG Circular Number-40/2022 dated 09.12.2022 and DG Circular No. 20/2018 has been directed earlier by 06.05.2018.

It is noted that around 21 months have been spent on the Uttar Pradesh Gang-based and Anti-Social Activity (Prevention) Rules-2021, but still, the gangs approved by the gangachar, Superintendent of Police, and District Magistrate while preparing gangachars at the district level and other follow-up proceedings at the district level, such as Police Commissioner, Superintendent of Police, and District Magistrate, are not being followed. The accused of the gang-banned Act on the basis of flawed gangachers are being challenged by the accused before the Hon'ble High Court or during the hearing.

At the field level, the Uttar Pradesh Gang and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Rules-2021 are not being complied with correctly. The fact of compliance with the system set by the Uttar Pradesh Gangism and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Rules-2021 is uncomfortable when the state advocate presents the state's side before the High Court, and its benefit is finally to the accused.

In Chapter-4 of the Uttar Pradesh Gang-Gang and Anti-Social Activity (Prevention) Rules-4, the gangachers and Chapter-6 have been described as the principles related to the seizure of property and various formats have been set for these proceedings. The arrangement of forwarding or approval has been given in the manual only after being satisfied personally by the officers who prepared, forwarded, and approved the gangachers. In the event of an error in the gangacher after the Uttar Pradesh Gang-based and Anti-Social Activity (Prevention) Rules-2021, individual responsibility has been determined for every level of officer who prepared, forwarded, and approved.

The Commissionerate District In-Charge will organize a workshop to introduce the in-charge inspectors, disciples in charge of the district, and anti-social activities (prevention) Rules-2021 to introduce the provisions. Law experts will be invited. In the workshops, inspectors and prisoners in charge of Commissionerate district will be nominated and ensured that every police inspector and prudent rules of the district get proper training regarding the provisions of 2021.

Therefore, all of you are directed that the Uttar Pradesh Gang and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act-1986 should be properly complied with Rules-2021 while taking action according to the provisions of the Act-1986. Action will be taken as per rules in case of violation of instructions.

Sincerely,

(Vijay Kumar)
