Dear Madam/Sir,

Having Heard Learned Counsel For the Petitioner and Learned Standing Counsel and Having Gone Through the Instructions which have been sent by the Director General of Police, the court is definitely of the view that if no investigation was ordered by the concerned magistrate, the same should be taken into cognizance. Even though in the instant case, whether the passport can be refused on the basis of a criminal case is not the question involved, we are of the view that even during the pendency of issued/renewed passports as per the government order dated 25.8.1993, if the court passes orders for that purpose.

In the instant case, we find that the application of the petitioner was rejected on the basis of two reports of non-cognizable cases, namely NCR No. 112/2012 and NCR No. 118/2018. The Director General of Police has also given his view that the reports with regard to the non-cognizable cases could not be made the basis for rejecting an application for issuance of a passport if they had not been investigated into. Under such circumstances, we issue the following directions:

2. Regional Passport Officer, Regional Passport Office, Vipin Khand, Gomti Nagar.
